# Sonic-Pi-Music-Creation

My project is called Hip-hop Meets Guzheng. My idea is to combine modern hip-hop
style with traditional Chinese instruments to create a new sound.
Project challenge
This project posed both technical and artistic challenges for me. Firstly, this was my
first time making music, and as someone with no coding experience, I needed to
develop both skills. Secondly, the styles of guzheng and hip-hop are completely
different, so finding a balance between rhythm and melody was a challenge. But I was
incredibly confident in this project, hoping to fuse different cultures and integrate
traditional sounds into a new context.
Project type
I chose Musical Composition because I love hip-hop music. Before this project, I had
also wanted to write my own song, which intrigued me. I chose to combine hip-hop
with Chinese instruments, hoping to create a different sound and music that reflects
Chinese culture.
Coding environment
I chose Sonic Pi, it’s designed for live music programming and is perfect for hip-hop.
Most importantly, Sonic Pi can import custom samples, allowing me to incorporate
guzheng recordings into my work. Furthermore, it provides a wealth of tutorials and
learning materials, allowing beginners to quickly get started.
Resource requirements
Code: I will use the Sonic Pi resource package, which includes examples and
tutorials, as well as some code resources. I will also learn from a "Jazzy Hip-hop
generator" example on YouTube, written with Sonic Pi, that demonstrates how to
combine jazz and hip-hop elements.
Sampling: I will use a Chinese instrument sound (guzheng), building on the code I
learned from YouTube about importing external audio, saving audio formats, and
more.
Learning Resources: I will study Sonic Pi examples and tutorials, referencing hip-hop
beat demos on YouTube, and examples of integrating traditional Chinese instruments
with modern music on BiliBili. Additionally, I will refer to a YouTube tutorial on
how to insert external samples (such as the guzheng) into Sonic Pi, as well as a
tutorial on how to play the guzheng on TikTok using GarageBand.
Timeline
In Week 7, install Sonic Pi, create project files, and prepare guzheng samples.
In Week 8, program hip-hop drumbeats, including kick, snare, and hi-hat, and
incorporate swing.
In Week 9, add a bassline and establish an A/B structure to lay the foundation for the
work.
In Week 10, integrate the guzheng melody into the beat, adjusting pitch and tempo,
and balancing volume.
In Week 11, refine the arrangement, add transitions, and employ effects like reverb
and echo, resulting in a complete 1–2-minute draft.
In Week 12, finalize the mix, organize the code, export a demo, and submit it.
