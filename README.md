# Sonic-Pi-Music-Creation Hip-hop Meets Guzheng (Sonic Pi)

# What this is

This is a small music project using Sonic Pi.
I mixed a hip-hop drum beat with Chinese guzheng sounds.
The song is about 60 seconds long.
I wrote the code in main.rb to control how and when the sounds play.
It uses loops and samples to make the music step by step.

## Folder

- main.rb — Sonic Pi script
- samples — folder external MP3 guzheng samples
- finalVersion.wav - my final 60s song genereated by the main.rb in Sonic Pi

# How to use

Open Sonic Pi.
Open main.rb.

In the code, there are two file paths called bowedGuzheng and soloGuzheng.
You need to change these file paths to match your own folder or the correct place where the sample files are stored.
Press Run in Sonic Pi.

The music will play and stop after 60 seconds.
